        Starting high school is very exciting. However, a new environment can
        be difficult for students. Luckily, many people in school can help students face the challenges. In this passage from a student guidebook, the school
        counselor, Ms. Carter, lists two common worries for new students and shares a few useful tips.
        <br><br>
        The passage says hello to new students at Stillwater High School. It talks about how high school can be both exciting and hard. It talks about two things many students worry about: studying and getting along with others. The school counselors say it's okay to worry about these things and share tips to help.
        <br><br>
        Here are the two tips:<br>
        1.	Doing things on time: This means being good at studying and getting ready for tests. They talk about a method called the Eisenhower Matrix that helps to figure out what's most important and urgent.
        <br><br>
        2.	Talking well with others: They say it's important to talk and listen carefully to get along with people. It's not just about words; it's also about understanding facial expressions and how someone talks.
        <br><br>
        The passage ends by saying that every little thing you do in high school helps you grow. It tells students they can always ask the counselors for help whenever they need it.
        <br><br>
        I hope that the school also has a counselor that we can talk to every time we need something. Because sometimes talking to someone really eases our feelings and makes us feel lighter.
    <br><br>
        <i>Thank you so much, everyone, for listening. I hope we can have a wonderful time in high school.</i>

      <h4>“Hello everyone, we are here today to present our topic.” <br>
        "My name is ___________ and my student number is _____________."<br>
        “Where Do Our Digital Footprints Lead?”<br></h4>
        <p>Digital footprints are traces of data people leave online.
        <br>
        This passage talks about digital footprints and their effects—both the good and bad ones—on people's Internet browsing experiences. An understanding of digital footprints and their effects can help people better enjoy their Internet experiences.                 
        <br><br>
        A recent survey conducted in 2020 revealed that:
        <br>
        Internet users in Taiwan spend an average of nearly eight hours per day online. While this usage pattern isn't novel, what may surprise many is the revelation that every action and communication made by Internet users is stored as browser cookies, akin to leaving digital footprints.
        <br><br>
        Digital footprints enhance users' online experiences by streamlining their internet searches. Through the analysis of user behavior like browsing history, browser algorithms, and display content aligned with the user's interests.
        <br>
        This tailored approach optimizes user engagement, facilitating the discovery of advertisements or information related to their previous searches.  
        <br><br>
        However, this personalized experience comes with a potential downside.<br>
        Digital footprints may create a "filter bubble" effect”. So, we must make sure to think before we post and think before we search.

        <br><br>
        Student 2: How does diversity in trials impact the safety and effectiveness of new treatments?
        <br><br>
        Anchor 2: Well, recent evidence provides compelling support for this. In one study, a medication tested on only a specific group later showed unexpected reactions in another, emphasizing the importance of diverse trials to uncover potential side effects.
        <br><br>
        Student 3: Are there other examples illustrating the importance of diversity in clinical trials?
        <br><br>
        Anchor 1: Absolutely! Another study focused on cancer treatment found that different ethnicities responded differently to a drug, showcasing the need for diverse samples to tailor treatments effectively for all populations.
        <br><br>
        Anchor 2: The bottom line here is that diversity in clinical trials is critical. It not only ensures the safety of new treatments but also makes them more effective across diverse populations.
        <br><br>
